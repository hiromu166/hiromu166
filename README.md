# Hi, I'm hiromu
I'm a data scientist and independent researcher based in 🗼 Tokyo. My main area of interest is natural language processing. I've performed well in data science competitions and have published several research papers. In my free time, I enjoy ☕ coffee, making latte art, and collecting and appreciating 🖼️ art.
